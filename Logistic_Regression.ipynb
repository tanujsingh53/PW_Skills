        "**Q1.** What is Logistic Regression, and how does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "Answer: Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification problems. It predicts the probability that an observation belongs to a particular category, using the logistic (sigmoid) function to map output values between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear Regression predicts continuous numerical values and uses the least squares method.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression predicts discrete categories (e.g., yes/no) and uses maximum likelihood estimation.\n",
        "\n",
        "In logistic regression, the dependent variable is categorical, whereas in linear regression, it’s continuous.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q2.** Role of the Sigmoid Function in Logistic Regression\n",
        "Answer: The sigmoid function transforms a linear combination of features into a probability between 0 and 1:\n",
        "\n",
        "σ(z)= 1/ 1+e^-z\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This mapping allows the model to interpret outputs as probabilities, which can then be thresholded (e.g., 0.5) to make binary predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q3. **Regularization in Logistic Regression and Why It’s Needed\n",
        "Answer: Regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting by discouraging overly complex models:\n",
        "\n",
        "L1 (Lasso): Adds the absolute value of coefficients (encourages sparsity).\n",
        "\n",
        "L2 (Ridge): Adds the square of coefficients (shrinks weights).\n",
        "It helps improve generalization by controlling the magnitude of feature coefficients.\n",

        "*   **Feature Engineering:** Create new features that could be relevant for predicting response, such as:\n",
        "    *   Customer purchase history (frequency, recency, monetary value).\n",
        "    *   Customer demographics.\n",

        "*   **Understand the problem:** With only 5% of customers responding, the dataset is highly imbalanced. Simply training a model on this data will likely result in a model that predicts the majority class (non-responders) most of the time, leading to high accuracy but poor performance on the minority class (responders).\n",
        "*   **Choose a resampling technique:** Several techniques can address class imbalance:\n",

        "    *   **Recall (Sensitivity):** Of all the customers who actually responded, what proportion did the model correctly identify?\n",
        "    *   **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.\n",
        "    *   **ROC-AUC:** Measures the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. A higher AUC indicates better discrimination.\n",
        "    *   **Confusion Matrix:** Provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.\n",

        "*   **Interpret coefficients:** Analyze the model's coefficients to understand which features are most influential in predicting customer response. This can provide valuable business insights.\n",
        "*   **Set a probability threshold:** Instead of using the default 0.5 threshold for classification, consider adjusting it based on the business objective. For example, if the cost of a false negative (failing to identify a responder) is higher than the cost of a false positive (incorrectly identifying a non-responder), you might lower the threshold to increase recall.\n",
        "*   **Deploy the model:** Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to predict customer responses for future marketing campaigns.\n",
        "*   **Monitor and retrain:** Continuously monitor the model's performance in production and retrain it periodically with new data to ensure it remains accurate and relevant.\n",
